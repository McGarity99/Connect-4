# Connect-4
Repository for a pure Go command-line implementation of traditional Connect 4 / Four in a Row game.  
Current implementation is only for Human vs Computer with basic random-select AI for the computer opponent.  
Future updates may expand on the AI and this file will be updated to reflect any such changes.
